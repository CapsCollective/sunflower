# Sulfur & Sunflowers

A game about post-apocalyptic farming chaos made in Godot.

## BEFORE READING

We're developing this game as an open-source product primarily **for the benefit of other game developers** who might want to see how to turn an open-source, hobby project into something releasable to storefronts.

If you just want to go play the game, then please support us by wishlisting it, and purchasing it through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/caps-collective) or [itch.io](https://capscollective.itch.io) when it becomes available. But until then, **feel free to [drop us a message on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Nnqd4YSdXN) for a beta key - we're always super happy to get playtesters!**

The project is being developed out of our shared passion for putting out cool experiences and is solely being funded by our own blood, sweat, tears, the _continual ritual sacrifice of elves_ and whatever we can get from Steam and itch sales.

## Contributing

**Have you found a bug?** Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/CapsCollective/sunflower/issues/new/choose) and we'll get working on a fix right away!

**Have an idea to optimise or fix our code?** We're happy to take a look at any PRs you submit!

## Licence

The game is released under a [modified MIT licensing agreement](LICENCE) (thank you to [DwarfCorp](https://github.com/Blecki/dwarfcorp)). That means all source code is free to use, modify and distribute. However, we have explicitly disallowed modification and redistribution of the following game content (which remains proprietary):

- Images (sprites, textures, etc.)
- 3D Models
- Sound Effects
- Music
- Game Content (these are all files stored within the `assets/content` directory of the repo)

No forks, binary redistributions, or other redistributions of this repository may include the proprietary game content. It is up to the redistributor to provide their own game content. "Source code" may also include raw text files, JSON library files, and XML configuration files (which are for the most part, not considered proprietary "game data") with the explicit exception of those containing "game content", such as our own writing.

Basically **we just want to protect the creative content we've worked super hard to produce**, but the engineering work we've done is all free (as in freedom)! We understand it's complicated, so if you have a question about the licensing, please raise an issue on the repository and we can talk it out together.
